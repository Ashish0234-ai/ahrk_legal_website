            Disclaimer:
            The information provided in this FAQ is for general educational purposes only and
            does not constitute legal advice. For guidance on specific matters, a formal
            consultation is required.

            <h3>1. Which courts do you practice in? </h3>

            We appear before the Honâ€™ble Supreme Court of India, various High Courts,
            District Courts, and tribunals across India. Representation depends on the nature
            and jurisdiction of the matter.

            <h3>2. What types of civil matters do you handle?</h3>

            We provide representation in matters such as property disputes, partition suits,
            contract enforcement, recovery cases, injunctions, succession matters, and other
            civil law disputes in accordance with statutory procedures.

            <h3>3. What types of criminal matters do you handle? </h3>

            We provide representation in criminal matters including bail applications,
            anticipatory bail, FIR-related matters, trial proceedings, appeals, revisions, and
            matters under special legislations such as the Prevention of Corruption Act,
            POCSO Act, and NDPS Act.

            <h3>4. Do you handle writ petitions and constitutional matters? </h3>

            Yes, we represent individuals, groups, and institutions in writ petitions and other
            constitutional remedies before the Supreme Court and High Courts, including
            matters relating to fundamental rights, administrative actions, and statutory
            compliance.

            <h3>5. Do you provide advisory services in specialized areas of law?</h3>

            We provide advisory and representation in areas such as cybercrime, banking and
            finance law, intellectual property rights, environment law, and alternative dispute
            resolution, in accordance with applicable legal frameworks.

            <h3>6. What is Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)?</h3>

            ADR includes mechanisms such as arbitration, mediation, and negotiation, which
            allow parties to resolve disputes outside traditional court proceedings. Our work in
            ADR is conducted in accordance with statutory provisions, including the
            Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

            <h3>7. Can legal advice be provided online or over email?</h3>

            We can provide general educational guidance online or via email. However,
            specific legal advice or representation requires formal engagement and cannot be
            offered without reviewing the facts and documentation of the matter.

            <h3>8. Do you provide representation in environmental matters?</h3>

            Yes, we provide representation and advisory services in environmental law
            matters, including compliance with statutory provisions, environmental clearances,
            pollution disputes, and matters before relevant authorities and courts.
